# Community Assemblage Methodology

## 16s Ribosomal RNA (rRNA)

Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs) sequences with 99% similarity is now the standard with more high-quality and high-throughput sequencing techniques (Brussaard et al 2016).

## Measuring fine details of interactions 

Individual exchanged molecules using metabolomics

Interference of entire co-occurrence networks based on metagenomic sequencing

Direct detection of interspp syngergy using microfluidics
