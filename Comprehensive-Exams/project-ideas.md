Holobiont Integration: comparison between two spp:  
- in-depth comparison of antioxidant system function; enzyme expression in both thermal and ocean acidification systems  
- algal gene expression analysis: difference in communities and photosystem and antioxidant related function  
- TET enzyme function difference b/w 2 spp (Erin M.)  
- Physiological variability differences (1st chapter)

Differential analysis of CpG O/E for variety of species that are well described in their tolerance  

With Kev: WGBS and CpG O/E comparison for historical vs. current different in methylation levels (see google doc [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DgdaTkA-k0s6mpmhNOIgqzoPjsVEJjd4DWl56Lg2BLI/edit).)

Difference in bleaching states: methylation patterns and GE expression (2nd chapter)

Higher thermal variability leads to higher tolerance, methylation patterns are dynamic and plastic so a transplant to HV will have a consistent enough signal to change this (ch 3). Methylation isn't set and is dynamic to consistent signal and inducible by env. change
