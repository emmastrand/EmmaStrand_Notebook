Physiological legacy effects / coral multivariate trait space (physiotype)

Melanin - immune cytotoxic response can provide an initial first line of defense and potentially primes antioxidant activity (legacy effect). Melanin synthesis pathway that is active in wound-healing and pathogen invasion while serving as a photoprotectant.

Host and symbiont have enzymatic defenses to mitigate oxidative stress (peroxidase, catalase, superoxidate dismutase). Sources of damage in host = heat-damaged mitochondrial membranes); symbiont source of damage = D1 protein of photosystem II (PSII). Ultimately lead to apoptosis and dysbiosis.
