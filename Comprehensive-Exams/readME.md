# Comprehensive Exam Study Guide

A compilation of my resources for studying for comprehensive exams. Each folder refers to a topic, each with several markdown files of notes and figures as well as the PDFs of papers referenced.

## Dr. Hollie Putnam's Exam

- signal transduction pathways; feedback loops, specific examples  
- alternative interpretations for why methylation might not be the only player  
- epigenetics/methylation details and history of the field  
- interaction between genetics for evolutionary outcomes  

semi-open book; HP chooses the resources available  
will email in the morning with questions and need to return them by certain time.
