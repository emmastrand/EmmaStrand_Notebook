# Comprehensive Exam Study Guide

A compilation of my resources for studying for comprehensive exams. Each folder refers to a topic, each with several markdown files of notes and figures as well as the PDFs of papers referenced.

**Logistics**    
"The graduate manual has not been updated with the changes quite yet. You are not required to go through our office to schedule your comprehensive exams. You will schedule with your committee and then your major professor will submit the results." - Graduate School

## Dr. Hollie Putnam's Exam

- signal transduction pathways; feedback loops, specific examples  
- alternative interpretations for why methylation might not be the only player  
- epigenetics/methylation details and history of the field  
- interaction between genetics for evolutionary outcomes  

semi-open book; HP chooses the resources available. In the past her exam has been 8 hours.  
will email in the morning with questions and need to return them by certain time.
