# Comprehensive Exam Study Guide

A compilation of my resources for studying for comprehensive exams. Each folder refers to a topic, each with several markdown files of notes and figures as well as the PDFs of papers referenced.

**Logistics**    
"The graduate manual has not been updated with the changes quite yet. You are not required to go through our office to schedule your comprehensive exams. You will schedule with your committee and then your major professor will submit the results." - Graduate School
