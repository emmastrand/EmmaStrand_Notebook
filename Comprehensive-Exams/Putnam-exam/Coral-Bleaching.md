# Biology of Coral Bleaching

Chapter 8:

Symbiosis = dependent on productivity of intracellular algal symbionts and requires photosynthetic production in each host cell.

Oxidative theory of coral bleaching:  
- ROS generation by algal photosynthesis then overwhelms host and symbiont mechanisms to detoxify ROS and repair oxidative damage.  
- High temps and irradiance = large quantify and rate of energy entering/being processed by photosystems (light-harvesting complexes, photosynthetic ETS in algal chloroplast)  
- surrounding host membranes and tissues constrain efflux of photosynthetically generated O2 away from algae and import of dissolved inorganic carbon to maintain photosynthetic carbon fixation  
- thus susceptible to oxidative damage  
- failure of the above is likely driving coral bleaching cascades
