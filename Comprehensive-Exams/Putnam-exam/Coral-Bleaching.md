Chapter 8.2: Thermal Response of Algal Symbiont

Symbiosis = dependent on productivity of intracellular algal symbionts and requires photosynthetic production in each host cell.

Oxidative theory of coral bleaching:  
- ROS generation by algal photosynthesis then overwhelms host and symbiont mechanisms to detoxify ROS and repair oxidative damage.  
- High temps and irradiance = large quantify and rate of energy entering/being processed by photosystems (light-harvesting complexes, photosynthetic ETS in algal chloroplast)  
- surrounding host membranes and tissues constrain efflux of photosynthetically generated O2 away from algae and import of dissolved inorganic carbon to maintain photosynthetic carbon fixation  
- thus susceptible to oxidative damage  
- failure of the above is likely driving coral bleaching cascades

Carotenoid peridinin:  
- possesses a higher absorbance of green to blue light relative to chlorophyll.  
- symbionts use this together with chlorophyll a and c pigmentation.  
- gives the symbionts the golden brown color and dark tone to the coral  
- integrated into intrinsic membrane-bound antenna chlorophyll a and c2-peridinin-protein-complex that transfers E to photosystems.

Light goes through the above complexes and enters the ETS from PSII to PSI to ferredoxin-nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADP+) reductase. Efficiency of this can be assessed by active chlorophyll induction fluorometry.  
- Maximum quantum yield of PSII chl-a flourescence = Fv/Fm = proportion of absorbed light E that enters ETS from PSII  
- Decline in above = nonspecific photoinactivation due to PSII damage
- reaction center protein D1 = particularly susceptible to photodamage  
- PSII and PSI are right next to each other within the thylakoid = bidirectional E transfer can happen, esp during thermal stress  
- Because of the above, excess light E can be directed away from PSII to PSI to be converted to heat and quenched by reduced reaction center chlorophyll P700+.

PSII degradation:  
- reduces capacity of photosynthetic apparatus to use light E and therefore increased pressure on the remaining PSII units  

High O2 env (hyperoxic) = increase in rate of spontaneous/catalyzed ROS production by ETS. Release of ROS from algae is b/c of overexcitation of photosynthetic apparatus.  
- mostly occurs via water-water cycle/Mehler rxn: direct reduction of O2 by PSI to superoxide (O2-), which is caused by high light or combination of high light and temperature.  
- results in enhanced ATP production at expense of NADPH (antioxidant systems need NADPH)  

High light = condensation of thylakoid lamellae  
High temp = thylakoid membrane disorganization  

Leakage of ROS from algal cell initiates bleaching cascade.

Nitric oxide (NO) = important cellular signaling molecule that is involved in immunity, response to endosymbiotic microbes, and apoptosis pathways  
- in high temps and bleaching, symbionts increase NO production  
- NO is lipophilic and can cross membranes into the host cell  
- NO is also reactive nitrogen species that reacts with superoxide to form a highly toxic oxidant and electron transport inhibitor  

DMSP = ROS scavenger and readily crosses membranes  
- increased production by host in stress  
- Differentially produced by hosts in response to osmotic stress; may be additional antioxidant system  

#### Calvin-Benson Cycle

High demand for DIC from seawater by coral holobiont to support photosynthesis and host calcification.  
- DIC in seawater is overwhelmingly bicarbonate (HCO3-) and b/c of its charge cannot cross membranes  
- adequate supply of DIC to algal symbionts = critical for productivity and redox state as carbon fixation is ultimate result of electron transport  
- b/c of many layers of membranes and high density of symbionts in coral tissues, carbon-concentrating mechanisms are required by both partners

High temps inhibit the Calvin-Benson cycle, limiting carbon fixation as an E sink
