# Signal transduction pathways in corals

## Thermostranduction  

Neurobiology of TRP Channels in invertebrates [book chapter 4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK476114/) (cross reference with what is in corals):  
- Mechanosensory neurons have to detect mechanical stimuli and thermosensory neurons have to detect temperatures warmer and cooler than the preferred.  
- Transient receptor potential (TRP) genes encode cation channels with key roles in fxn of sensory neurons. TRP channel subunits detect mechanical and thermal stimuli.

Calcium dependent protein kinase 2 is uprelated in heat stress and plays a role in signal transduction pathways that involve calcium as a second messenger ([Bellantuono et al 2018](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/508184v1.full)).

Pre-conditioning-based improvements in thermal tolerance in *P. acuta* are accompanied by host increases in glutathione reductase (GR) activity and expression. This supports reducing intracellular environment that facilitates ROS scavenging and prevents DNA damage. Bax-inhibitor 1 (BI-1) could regulate GR expression in corals through Nrf2/ARE pathway ([Majerova and Drury 2021](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.03.15.435543v1.full)).

Transient receptor potential multigene superfamily encodes integral membrane proteins that function as ion channels (](https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/gb-2011-12-3-218)).  
- Most are non selective cation channels, only a few are Ca2+ selective  
- Gating mechanims include: ligand binding, voltage, and changes in temperature, covalent modifications of nucleophilic residues  
- Activated TRP channels cause depolarization of the cellular membrane, which in turn activates voltage-dependent ion channels and a change of intracellular Ca2+ concentration.

### Thermosensing

Chapter 3 of biochemical adaptation (Somero et al):  

TRP proteins = cation (positive charge) channels that when are thermosensors they are called thermoTRPs. TRP proteins can have differing fxns based on what cell they are in.  
- D. melanogaster genome encodes for 16 TRPs and the human genome encodes for 28 TRPs.  

Different types of channels:

![ion-channel](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Thomas-Hinze/publication/300113655/figure/fig1/AS:390564332752897@1470129201663/Schematic-representation-of-an-ion-channel-and-its-functional-principle-Cations.png)

Thermal response of thermoTRP variants depends on:  
1. Temperature at which an ortholog is activated, at which the ion channel opens and therefore neurofiring to occur. Activation temps of TRP channels can reflect differential thermal phenotypes.  
2. thermoTRPs differ in fxn for increases or decreases in temps.  
3. Responses of different paralogs of thermoTRPs to increases in temp differ with respecto severity of thermal stress. thermoTRPs are tuned to respond to either 1.) not harmful/moderate temps just beyond optimal range or 2.) potentially damaging temps that are well outside thermal range.

thermoTRPs fxn in conjunction with other temperature-sensing ion channel systems:  
- An alternative relies on cGMP as a regulatory signal: [cGMP] varies with temperature, so do activities of cGMP-gated ion channels thta modulate activities of thermosensing neurons.

In thermosensing neurons, ion flux rates through temp-sensing ion channels are very responsive to slight changes in temp.

dTRPA1 responds to mild heating  
TRP PYREXIA: activated at more extreme temperatures  
TRP PAINLESS: even more extreme temperatures

TRPs can also be involved in phototransduction.

TRPM3 (found in mammals) is conserved in Hydra vulgaris: nociceptor calcium channel involved in detection of noxious heat. heat shock protein and TRPM3 (i.e. pregnenolone sulfate) induces modulation of heat shock protein 70 and nitric oxide synthase (NOS). TRPM3 agonist and heat shock induce expression of nuclear txn enrythroid 2-related factor (Nrf2) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) ([Malafoglia et al 2016](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0151386)).

## Photo-related signaling

### Photoreception

[Hilton et al 2012](https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/pdfplus/10.1086/BBLv223n3p291?casa_token=IX5qI1PAmd0AAAAA:xmBWtl2_7mRXR87MmimOYBAKBJCqAvGhDh4PphSNgHGE3fJK88Fh4aN0OmCpRw4ZfVg2V_Y7SPy8):  
- Photoreceptors responding to light elevate calcium levels; calcium is a second messenger relaying light responses in corals  
- Photoreceptive cells of corals detect and respond to light by altering cytoplasmic calcium levels, similarly to transduction pathways in complex invertebrate eyes  
- Spawning timing can be altered by altering these levels of Ca2+  
- Corals have rhodopsins (visual) and melanopsins (non-visual) that are used as visual and nonvisual photoreceptors that act via calcium second messengers  
- Other proposed mechanisms prior to this were cryptochromes (Cry), which is a txn factor that shuttle between cytoplasm and nucleus as photoreceptor. This is confirmed in plants and in animals it serves as a txn factor regulated entrained circadian clocks. Cry is photosensitive in invertebrates, there is no evidence this acts as a photoreceptor  
- In an organism that uses calcium as a second messenger in light transduction, Ca2+ levels will oscillate accordingly and can be used to synchronize a circadian rhythm along with cyclic nucleotides

photoreceptor: initiator of light signaling cascades)

**Pathway in arthropods (use of calcium), proposed to be in corals**:  
1. Light strikes a rhodopsin photoreceptor  
2. This changes activity of a G-protein  
3. Specific to this arthropod example: G-protein regulates the activity of membrane-associated enzyme (phospholipase C: PLC)  
4. PLC drives the production of inositol triphosphate (IP3): soluble messenger that crosses from the membrane to ER where it binds to IP3 gated calcium channels  
5. This opens the Ca2+ channels and allowing the calcium in the ER to flood the cytoplasm and propogate the effects of the photon strike  

Mammalian pathway (cyclic nucleotide pathway):  
1. Photon striking a rhodopsin or opsin class photoreceptor activates a trimeric G-protein.  
2. In turn this regulates cyclic nucleotide levels in the cytoplasm and the level of this second messenger relay the effect of photo strike to cellular metabolism.

cyclic nucleotides (two most well documented):  
- cAMP (cyclic adenosine monophosphate) is a second messenger; derivative of ATP; used for intracellular signal transduction; cAMP-dependent pathway; cellular messaging    
- cGMP (cyclic guanosine monophosphate) regulates activity of protein kinase A (PKA) and protein kinase G (PKG).

Cndarians pathway; very similar to mammalian above:  
1. Ocelli = light-sensing organ utilized  
2. cAMP levels increase in response to light and sensing is relayed to muscles and allows jellyfish to swim in appropriate direction.  
Jellyfish planulae, single dispersed cells are photoreceptive. these microvillar cells have a motor cilium but this pathway is uncharacterized. Microvillar-type photoreceptive cells typically signal via calcium as a second messenger.

Corals have red-photosensitivity and preference for red-substrate during settlement. Hypothesis that long-wavelength sensitivity and color discrimination via rhodopsin-based visual system.

Rhodopsins are G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs): initiate signaling through heterotrimeric G proteins. This intxn results in GDP/GTP exchange and subsequent activation of enzymes or ion channels.

3 main takeaways:  
1. Acropsin 3 interacted with mammalian Gq transduction pathway.  
2. Acroposin 2 might fxn as RGR/peropsin family. Might play a role in phototaxis and directional light sensing.   
3. Acropsin 1 likely cannot determine directionality of light and probably not involved in larval phototaxis; possibly behaves in similar ways to vertebrate melanopsin.

## Reproduction

Gamete release from a broadcast spawning coral is potentially controlled by a series of G-protein-coupled signaling pathways; this might be a non-visual ocular photoreceptor such as melanopsin-like coral homolog and/or range of neuropeptide candidates. See below

Neuropeptides: act through G-protein coupled receptors; implicated in reproduction, metabolism, feeding, circadian rhythms, adaptive behaviors, cognition, etc.
