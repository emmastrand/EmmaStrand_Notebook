# Signal transduction pathways in corals

## Photo-related

### Photoreception

[Hilton et al 2012](https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/pdfplus/10.1086/BBLv223n3p291?casa_token=IX5qI1PAmd0AAAAA:xmBWtl2_7mRXR87MmimOYBAKBJCqAvGhDh4PphSNgHGE3fJK88Fh4aN0OmCpRw4ZfVg2V_Y7SPy8):  
- Photoreceptors responding to light elevate calcium levels; calcium is a second messenger relaying light responses in corals  
- Photoreceptive cells of corals detect and respond to light by altering cytoplasmic calcium levels, similarly to transduction pathways in complex invertebrate eyes  
- Spawning timing can be altered by altering these levels of Ca2+  
- Corals have rhodopsins (visual) and melanopsins (non-visual) that are used as visual and nonvisual photoreceptors that act via calcium second messengers  
- Other proposed mechanisms prior to this were cryptochromes (Cry), which is a txn factor that shuttle between cytoplasm and nucleus as photoreceptor. This is confirmed in plants and in animals it serves as a txn factor regulated entrained circadian clocks. Cry is photosensitive in invertebrates, there is no evidence this acts as a photoreceptor  
- In an organism that uses calcium as a second messenger in light transduction, Ca2+ levels will oscillate accordingly and can be used to synchronize a circadian rhythm along with cyclic nucleotides

photoreceptor: initiator of light signaling cascades)

**Pathway in arthropods (use of calcium), proposed to be in corals**:  
1. Light strikes a rhodopsin photoreceptor  
2. This changes activity of a G-protein  
3. Specific to this arthropod example: G-protein regulates the activity of membrane-associated enzyme (phospholipase C: PLC)  
4. PLC drives the production of inositol triphosphate (IP3): soluble messenger that crosses from the membrane to ER where it binds to IP3 gated calcium channels  
5. This opens the Ca2+ channels and allowing the calcium in the ER to flood the cytoplasm and propogate the effects of the photon strike  

Mammalian pathway (cyclic nucleotide pathway):  
1. Photon striking a rhodopsin or opsin class photoreceptor activates a trimeric G-protein.  
2. In turn this regulates cyclic nucleotide levels in the cytoplasm and the level of this second messenger relay the effect of photo strike to cellular metabolism.

cyclic nucleotides (two most well documented):  
- cAMP (cyclic adenosine monophosphate) is a second messenger; derivative of ATP; used for intracellular signal transduction; cAMP-dependent pathway; cellular messaging    
- cGMP (cyclic guanosine monophosphate) regulates activity of protein kinase A (PKA) and protein kinase G (PKG).

Cndarians pathway; very similar to mammalian above:  
1. Ocelli = light-sensing organ utilized  
2. cAMP levels increase in response to light and sensing is relayed to muscles and allows jellyfish to swim in appropriate direction.  
Jellyfish planulae, single dispersed cells are photoreceptive. these microvillar cells have a motor cilium but this pathway is uncharacterized. Microvillar-type photoreceptive cells typically signal via calcium as a second messenger.

Corals have red-photosensitivity and preference for red-substrate during settlement. Hypothesis that long-wavelength sensitivity and color discrimination via rhodopsin-based visual system.

Rhodopsins are G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs): initiate signaling through heterotrimeric G proteins. This intxn results in GDP/GTP exchange and subsequent activation of enzymes or ion channels.

3 main takeaways:  
1. Acropsin 3 interacted with mammalian Gq transduction pathway.  
2. Acroposin 2 might fxn as RGR/peropsin family. Might play a role in phototaxis and directional light sensing.   
3. Acropsin 1 likely cannot determine directionality of light and probably not involved in larval phototaxis; possibly behaves in similar ways to vertebrate melanopsin.

## Reproduction

Gamete release from a broadcast spawning coral is potentially controlled by a series of G-protein-coupled signaling pathways; this might be a non-visual ocular photoreceptor such as melanopsin-like coral homolog and/or range of neuropeptide candidates. See below

Neuropeptides: act through G-protein coupled receptors; implicated in reproduction, metabolism, feeding, circadian rhythms, adaptive behaviors, cognition, etc.
