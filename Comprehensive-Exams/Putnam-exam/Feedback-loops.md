# Physiological Feedback Loops

Feedback loop: when a stimulus or change in the environment is present, feedback loops respond to keep systems functioning near a set point, or ideal level.

Homeostasis is keeping that steady state to function at optimal levels regardless of external change. This is predominantly regulated by negative feedback loops.

Hormesis: conditioning or priming effects of a mild level of a stressor results in the organism being better able to cope with exposure to higher levels of the stressor when encountered on subsequent occasions.

## Examples in corals:

**Negative feedback**  
1. Temperature increases in the water, therefore increasing the coral's body temperature.  
2. Temperature increases activity of mitochondria and thus production of ROS. Also, TRP channel subunits detect thermal stimuli. See [Signal-Transduction](https://github.com/emmastrand/EmmaStrand_Notebook/blob/master/Comprehensive-Exams/Putnam-exam/Signal-transduction.md) for full pathway that can also enduce thermo-regulated processes.      
3. Coral increases antioxidant function to reduce ROS.  

**Positive feedback loops**

Symbiosis?

1. Endosymbiont exchange of nutrients  
2. Coral receiving excess nitrogen  
3. Keeps endosymbiont within cells to then continue the exchange of nutrients
