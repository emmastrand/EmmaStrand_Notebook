# Physiological Feedback Loops

Feedback loop: when a stimulus or change in the environment is present, feedback loops respond to keep systems functioning near a set point, or ideal level.

Homeostasis is keeping that steady state to function at optimal levels regardless of external change.

Hormesis: conditioning or priming effects of a mild level of a stressor results in the organism being better able to cope with exposure to higher levels of the stressor when encountered on subsequent occasions.
