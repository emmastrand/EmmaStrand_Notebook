# Genotype x Environment Interactions

The relationships of genotype x environment x physiology:

Adaptation:  
1. characters or traits observed in an organism that are a result of selection  
2. process in which natural selection adjusts the frequency of genes that code for traits affecting fitness.

Evidence of adaptation: only if a trait has changed through time in ways that it will make it more effective at its task, therefore enhance fitness. The below are three types of correlative evidence (which is never concrete):  
1. Correlation b/w character and environment/use.  
2. Comparisons of individual differences w/in a species.  
3. Observation of the effects of altering a character.

Traits become fixed b/c of natural selection, either presently selected on or previously selected on but now present for reasons that don't have much to do with the original reason for selection. The latter = phylogenetic inertia

**Optimality** is a relative concept and a particular design need only to be sufficient to do better than the existing alternatives (there is such thing as good enough). Natural selection doesn't necessarily provide maximal or even optimal solutions.

Genetic drift: chance shifts in gene frequencies  
Genetic bottleneck: the above can be particularly true in small pop sizes

Phylogeny matters:

The environment can act on many developmental stages:
