Back to back regional bleaching events 2014, 2015. Compared C vs. D symbiont dominated corals from 2 pCO2 variability distinct reefs (see Wall 2018 paper below for start).   

Physiological legacy effects / coral multivariate trait space (physiotype)

Melanin - immune cytotoxic response can provide an initial first line of defense and potentially primes antioxidant activity (legacy effect). Melanin synthesis pathway that is active in wound-healing and pathogen invasion while serving as a photoprotectant.

Host and symbiont have enzymatic defenses to mitigate oxidative stress (peroxidase, catalase, superoxidate dismutase). Sources of damage in host = heat-damaged mitochondrial membranes); symbiont source of damage = D1 protein of photosystem II (PSII). Ultimately lead to apoptosis and dysbiosis.

Bleaching was strongly related to symbiont community and their sensitivity to thermal stress, which was influenced by site environmental history. Physiotypes were shaped by immune and antioxidant activity in bleaching and recovery periods not related to symbiont community = host driven. Constitutive immunity from one year to the next.

### Wall et al 2018: Env hist / Thermal stress on coral phys / immunity

Paper link [here](https://par.nsf.gov/servlets/purl/10056422).

Effect of env. history of low vs. high variable pCO2 in Mcap on response to elevated temp to 30.5C (+6C above ambient).

1. Heating decreased maximum photochemical efficiency (Fv/Fm) and chlorophyll a pigmentation, but increased melanin.  
2. Intxn of env. history & temp treatment not observed.  
3. Greater pCO2 variability had higher constitutive antioxidative and immune activity (catalase, superoxide dismutase, prophenoloxidase) and Fv/Fm but lower melanin and chl-a.  
4. Greater variability promotes greater antioxidant and immune activity.  
5. Antioxidant levels were not influenced by thermal treatment, just as a fxn of environmental history.  
6. History did not interact with thermal stress to determine physiological state. Env history shaped starting point not during stress response.

Higher constitutive melanin exp in coral spp considered thermally tolerant (see Palmer papers).

Temp & pCO2 variability review.

Lagoons and back reefs experience greater daily temp/pCO2 than fore-reef. Habitats dominated by corals rather than algal expression a smaller diel pH variability b/c photosynthesis elevates pH.

History can present itself in four general ways:  
1. recent env. conditions can prime future responses to stress.  
2. Experience of one life history stage can carry over to affect the performance of a later life history stage.  
3. Transgenerational acclimatization - parents can integrate information from their environment and affect performance phenotypes of offspring.  
4. Local adaptation of populations.

Site five papers that tested variability:  
1. A. hyacinthus in American Samoa; high temp var = less mortality  and retained higher photosynthetic efficiency when exposed to heat stress (Oliver and Palumbi 2011)  
2. Corals transplanted to high variability site showed greater bleaching resistance in a thermal challenge (Palumbi et al 2014), but corals from HV and stayed at HV had the highest performance.   
3. Coral spp in NW Australia from thermally HV were more thermotolerant and less bleaching (Schoepf et al 2015)  
4. Coral larvae in Mo'orea with lower temp var but higher mean temp had more tolerance than larvae in Taiwan with higher temp var but lower mean temp (Rivest et al papers)  
5. No effect of temp history in thermal stress of +2C (Camp et al 2016).  

pH variability:
Cites ~6 experiments that all yielded no significance in response from pH distinct reefs.  
> This similarly lines up with Wall et al in that pH history didn't influence response in thermal stress but there were baseline differences. pH variability might not be critical in immediate stress response but chronic environmental signal may change physiological baselines.

Two ways to estimate difference b/w expt condition and natural regime of env. conditions:  
1. diff b/w expt conditions and mean condition reported from collection site  
2. diff b/w expt conditions and min or max of env. condition
