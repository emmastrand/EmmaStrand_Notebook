# The Flexible Phenotype

## Chapter 4

Metabolic ceiling: the maximum energy output that can possibly be sustained by an organism that eats enough to stay in energy balance.

Basal metabolic rate (BMR): standard conditions, baseline before any extra energy exerted.

**Maximal sustained working levels**: the aerobic capacity for work of animals as it is limited by evolutionarily shaped physiological constraints.  
- Animals that choose to ignore this 'physiological warning level' would lose body condition and face precipitous increases in mortality risk.

**Optimal working capacity**: energetic performance level of parents beyond which they would suffer from increased risks due to physical fatigue, infection, and predation.

'Capital' energy spender: rely on stored resources  
'Income' spenders that rely on concurrent intake of nutrients or energy
