# The Flexible Phenotype

## Chapter 4

Metabolic ceiling: the maximum energy output that can possibly be sustained by an organism that eats enough to stay in energy balance.

Basal metabolic rate (BMR): standard conditions, baseline before any extra energy exerted.

**Maximal sustained working levels**: the aerobic capacity for work of animals as it is limited by evolutionarily shaped physiological constraints.  
- Animals that choose to ignore this 'physiological warning level' would lose body condition and face precipitous increases in mortality risk.

**Optimal working capacity**: energetic performance level of parents beyond which they would suffer from increased risks due to physical fatigue, infection, and predation.

'Capital' energy spender: rely on stored resources  
'Income' spender: rely on concurrent intake of nutrients or energy

One can argue that 'maximum sustained working levels' are only achieved by animals that are 'income' spenders  
- b/c they maintain energy balance over the period of peak performance.

'Sustained metabolic scope' (factorial scope):

### Weiner's barrel model: metabolic ceilings  

**Five constraints on energy (bow-ties):**   
Bow-tie A: availability of energy in the environment  
- But it is unlikely that this restrains maximal performance  
- The rate at which energy can be harvested often exceeds the rate at which it can be processed.

Bow-tie C: limited by capacity to excrete metabolic end-products.  
- i.e. kidneys to excrete urea

For awhile 2 main hypotheses existed to explain maximal performance.  
1.) *central limitation hypothesis* (Bow-tie B): related to the capacity of the alimentary tract to absorb energy (food-processing chain)  
2.) *peripheral limitation hypothesis* (Bow-tie D): related to the capacity to expend energy at the different sites of utilization (i.e. respiratory chain, with muscles, mammalian brown adipose tissue and mammary glands)

Performance limits are not set centrally:  
- Mice that increased food-intake rates when muscles and BAT were made to work harder in the cold, suggested that it was actually the capacity of the mammary glands that set the upper limit -- so back to the hypothesis #2.

allometric scaling constant  
- in mammals this is consistently higher in maximal metabolic rate compared to BMR  

#### Long term fitness assets

Increase body size, increase in energy required to maintain, increase in BMR levels.

Symmorphosis: a single site does not limit aerobic performance.

If very hard work precipitously increases the likelihood of death (b/c of free radical derived oxidative DNA and tissue damage), without leading to compensatory increases in reproductive output, **evolutionary trade-offs would select for animals that are not prepared to work harder than what is called the 'optimal working capacity'**. Emphasizes the cost of high performance.

In birds: The mechanisms for a lower rate of ageing and bodily decline, which relate to mitochondrial functioning and the ways that electron leakage and free-radical production are balanced under conditions of high and low energy demands.

animals are reluctant habitually to spend as much as they are physiologically capable of.

how would you measure metabolic ceiling in a coral? See Barott papers?

## Chapter 5: Phenotypic plasticity: matching phenotypes to environmental demands

Plastic barnacle penis example of environment influencing phenotype and function.

Use it or lose it:  
- heart morphology based on usage: atrophy vs. hypertrophy  
- in space calf muscle decreases by 20% and in on earth weightless scenarios. positive correlation of decrease in leg muscles (%) and duration of unloading experiment

After losing it, it is possible to regain it:  
- astronauts 6 mos post flight can regain % muscle

Dynamic gut: snakes go through veritable 'gastrointestinal rebirths': going without meals for so long that stonachs, intestines, and accesory organs shrink and become 'dormant'  
- when they eat again, it is a huge meal and there is a burst of physiological activity by orders of magnitude
