# The Flexible Phenotype

## Chapter 4

Metabolic ceiling: the maximum energy output that can possibly be sustained by an organism that eats enough to stay in energy balance.

Basal metabolic rate (BMR): standard conditions, baseline before any extra energy exerted.

**Maximal sustained working levels**: the aerobic capacity for work of animals as it is limited by evolutionarily shaped physiological constraints.  
- Animals that choose to ignore this 'physiological warning level' would lose body condition and face precipitous increases in mortality risk.

**Optimal working capacity**: energetic performance level of parents beyond which they would suffer from increased risks due to physical fatigue, infection, and predation.

'Capital' energy spender: rely on stored resources  
'Income' spender: rely on concurrent intake of nutrients or energy

One can argue that 'maximum sustained working levels' are only achieved by animals that are 'income' spenders  
- b/c they maintain energy balance over the period of peak performance.

'Sustained metabolic scope' (factorial scope):

Importance of energy balance during sustained higher metabolic rates.

Weiner's barrel model: metabolic ceilings  
- energy absorbed into the body (bow-tie B) is not the only process that can constrain sustined energy intake and expenditure.  
- four other processes:
