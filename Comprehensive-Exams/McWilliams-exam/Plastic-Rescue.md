# Mechanisms of Plastic Rescue

*Notes may not be my own language, as some sections were directly taken from the manuscripts I studied and are cited in the main header or in a parenthesis.*

Mechanisms (i.e. developmental switches) can move an organism towards a new adaptive peak or could result in a maladaptive response. Ability to be plastic and plastic responses come with high energetic demand (i.e. delays in reproduction, increased individual investment, reduced fecundity).

Plasticity: the ability of a genotype to develop different phenotypes in response to cues like environmental conditions. Includes morphological development, regulation of gene expression, and behavior.

This process of *individual* plasticity can be immediate and within a single generation, thus providing a potential first stage of rescue that comes before adaptation and evolutionary rescue of a *population*. **BUT, this is not always beneficial. Immediate plastic responses can be maladaptive because little to no selection has occured on this response to completely new conditions.**

Developmental mechanisms (causes) of plasticity (in order of least likely to most likely to produce an adaptive response):  
1. Evolved developmental switches  
2. Generalized physiological responses to stressors  
3. Development selection

The mechanism may influence proportion of population that survives a novel condition, fecundity, time between generations, rate of population growth, and how evolution plays out.

**The mechanisms that are likely to produce a highly adaptive response to a novel environment are also the most costly, shifting a slower life history and less pronounced evolutionary response at the population level.**

1.) Evolved developmental switches are least likely to result in an adaptive response because they are specific to historically relevant environments. 2.) Generalized physiological responses are relatively more likely because these are general to a range of environments. 3.) Developmental selection are most likely because individuals sample phenotypes over developmental time, adopting those that specifically match the new condition.

Big question: can this be optimized within an individual's lifespan?

#### Evolved developmental switches

Polyphenism: where one of several discrete alternate phenotypes is induced in different conditions.  
- nutrition-dependent mating tactics in beetles ([Moczek & Emlen 2000](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0003347299913428))  
- smaller males are hornless, large males that exceed a critical body size develop a pair of long, curved horns  
- "Thus, horn possession confers a clear advantage to males using fighting behaviours to access females, whereas hornlessness may be favoured in males that rely primarily on sneaking behaviours. Combined, the two alternative reproductive tactics used by male O. taurus appear to favour opposite horn phenotypes, which may explain the paucity of intermediate morphologies in natural populations of O. taurus."

These are in response to specific, predictive environmental cues.

A polyphenic trait is a trait for which multiple, discrete phenotypes can arise from a single genotype as a result of differing environmental conditions. It is therefore a special case of phenotypic plasticity (Wikipedia). Polyphenisms are discrete compared to continuous scale (i.e. height and weight is continuous and the ability to curl your tongue is discrete).

> Come back to thinking about if corals have any polyphenisms? There are some corals of the same species that develop in plate morphologies or pillar morphologies... then the cue would be sunlight exposure?

Examples of cues: predator chemicals, photoperiod, temperature induced developmental regulatory program, UV light (can induce melanization in some species)

How adaptive this is would depend on the context of the novel environment:  
- If the novel condition was on a continuum then a preexisting plastic response could be adaptive in the new condition (i.e. rising temperatures)  
- If the environment shifts to an extreme or in a discrete manner (i.e. toxins), the tailored switches may not be adaptive in this scenario. Also in this scenario, previously cryptic variation could be exposed and lead to adaptive responses. This could be more up to chance and only a subset of the population to survive. 

#### Generalized physiological responses to stressors

More likely to result in adaptive responses to things like novel toxins, heat stress, pathogens

#### Developmental selection

Rely on within-individual selective processes; shaping of tissue architecture, trial-and-error learning, acquired immunity. Likely to result in adaptive response.
