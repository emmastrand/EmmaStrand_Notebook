# Mechanisms of Plastic Rescue

Mechanisms (i.e. developmental switches) can move an organism towards a new adaptive peak or could result in a maladaptive response. Ability to be plastic and plastic responses come with high energetic demand (i.e. delays in reproduction, increased individual investment, reduced fecundity).

Plasticity: the ability of a genotype to develop different phenotypes in response to cues like environmental conditions. Includes morphological development, regulation of gene expression, and behavior.

This process of *individual* plasticity can be immediate and within a single generation, thus providing a potential first stage of rescue that comes before adaptation and evolutionary rescue of a *population*. **BUT, this is not always beneficial. Immediate plastic responses can be maladaptive because little to no selection has occured on this response to completely new conditions.**

Developmental mechanisms (causes) of plasticity:  
1. Evolved developmental switches  
2. Generalized physiological responses to stressors  
3. Development selection

The mechanism may influence proportion of population that survives a novel condition, fecundity, time between generations, rate of population growth, and how evolution plays out.

**The mechanisms that are likely to produce a highly adaptive response to a novel environment are also the most costly, shifting a slower life history and less pronounced evolutionary response at the population level.**

#### Generalized physiological mechanims

More likely to result in adaptive responses to things like novel toxins, heat stress, pathogens

#### Developmental selection

Rely on within-individual selective processes; shaping of tissue architecture, trial-and-error learning, acquired immunity. Likely to result in adaptive response.
