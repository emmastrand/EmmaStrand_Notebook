# Biochemical Adaptation: Somero et al

## Chapter 1: Conceptual Foundation for Understanding Biochemical Adaptation

Stressor: env. factor that perturbs biochem structures/fxn  
Stress: change induced in the system by stressor

biochemical systems: *efficient*: enzymatic enhancement of chemical reaction rates; *accurate*: copying, transcribing, translating genetically coded information in the cell; *responsive*: rapid and sophisticated signaling and subsequent effector responses that make changes internally or externally.  
- This all depends on reversible changes in molecular shape during function

Marginal stability and fluidity:  
- a middle ground between stability to ensure existence but not so rigid that a molecular cannot undergo changes when needed. a balancing act and spectrum of rigid conformation to marginally stable conformation to too flexible a conformation  
- fluidity reflects a capacity for altering shape

ligand: substrate of enzymatic rxn  
protein "softness": ease at which a protein's surface can alter geometry

Ultimate vs proximate causes:  
- Ultimate: selective advantages that led to the origin and retention of a trait; *"why?"*  
- Proximate: refer to the "mechanism"/the means by which the beneficial trait is achieved.

intermediate level of protein structural stability (not too rigid or too flexible) is important to ensure optimal protein function. the proximate cause would be amino acid substitutions that modify the inherent structural stability of the protein OR modulating the intracellular fluid that bathes the protein. Either way the same result could occur of intermediate level of protein stability
