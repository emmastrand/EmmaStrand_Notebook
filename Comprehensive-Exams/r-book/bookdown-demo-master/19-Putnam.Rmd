**DNA methylation triggered by and/or follow patterns of higher gene expression levels**

Methylation is used to repress transposable elements [(Zemach et al 2010)](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/sci/328/5980/916.full.pdf?casa_token=R15N1bM98WUAAAAA:gNE98aPZf3ht_qY9FqQkkDG45ZmKDZeixCdVMjQedXScX-MnClRvSTeIl5YnBDzfOpg8kBZ3DCQ).

"A transposable element (TE, transposon, or jumping gene) is a DNA sequence that can change its position within a genome, sometimes creating or reversing mutations and altering the cell's genetic identity and genome size. Transposition often results in duplication of the same genetic material."

Come back to this..

[Neri et al 2017](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature21373)

Dnmt3b binds preferentially to the gene bodies by interacting with histone modification H3K36me3. Dnmt3b occurs preferentially on genes within third and fourth quartiles of expression level and correlates with H3K36me3 histone modification.

Knock out of Dnmt3b reduces gene body DNA methylation, increases intragenic RNA Pol II spurious entry and transcription initiation events.


## Taxonomy and biology of study organisms {-}

**Coral Species** 

*Montipora capitata*:  

Kingdom: Animalia  
Phylum: Cnidaria  
Class: Anthozoa  
Order: Scleractinia  
Suborder: Vacatina  
Family: Acroporidae  
Genus: Montipora
Species: capitata

Encrusting; corallites tiny and separated by coenosteum; walls and septa are indistinct; skeleton = porous; small, smooth projections = verrucae  

Clade: Robust corals

Broadcasting corals

*Pocillopora acuta*

Kingdom: Animalia  
Phylum: Cnidaria  
Class: Anthozoa  
Order: Scleractinia  
Suborder: Refertina  
Family: Pocilloporidae  
Genus: Pocillopora
Species: acuta (spp.)

Clade: Complex corals

Polyps are hermaphrodite/brooding corals  

**Coral anatomy:**

coenosteum: strong and calcareous ectodermal tissue.    
corallite: is a skeletal 'cup' that is formed by an individual polyp where the polyp sits and can retract.  
septum (plural septa): is one of the radiating vertical plates lying within the corallite wall  
verruace: mounds of coenosteum on the surface of many species of Montipora and Pocillopora that are wider than a corallite

Glossary of coral anatomy terms: [here](http://www.coralsoftheworld.org/page/glossary/).

“complex” clade show a greater tendency towards porous skeletons and branching shapes.  
“robust” species tend to be more solidly calcified and grow in flattened or rounded shapes.

**Symbiodiniaceae Species**

Domain: Eukaryota  
Phylum: Dinoflagellata  
Class: Dinophyceae  
Order: Suessiales
Family: Symbiodiniaceae
11 genera: I focus on *Cladocopium spp.* and *Durusdinium spp.*.

Mutualistic dinoflagellates; reside within symbiosome structure

Anatomy:

## Nutritional crosstalk between host and symbiont {-}

[Cunning et al 2017](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022519317303636)  
[Fournier 2013](http://biologie.ens-lyon.fr/biologie/ressources/bibliographies/pdf/m1-12-13-biosci-reviews-fournier-a-2c-m.pdf?lang=fr)

Bleaching exacerbated by nutrients and attenuated by feeding

Symbionts translocate photosynthetically fixed carbon to support coral metabolism, also provide:  
- amino acids, maltose, krebs cycle molecules, pyruvate.  

Coral provides inorganic nutrients and carbon dioxide, acetate   
- Coral gets nitrogen from seawater and prey

Resources are acquired proportionally to surface area, and surface area is proportional to volume

Temperature lowers the threshold for light; light = proximate stressor

CCM - moving carbon to high concentrations at photosynthetically active sites so Rubisco can fix them

**Host on algal cell**  

Non-motile state b/c host produces lectin SLL-2 that binds to specific glycoproteins on the algal cell surface and maintains this state

Host can modulate calcium signaling in algae cell to control release of fixed carbon to its own tissues

Host can restrict nutrient availability to control algal cell density or expel or digest cells to control population


**Starting symbiosis**  
Positive chemotaxis of motile symbionts towards newly settled hosts that release chemicals and both increases chances of contact

**Recognition**  
Only in horizontally transmitted:  
1. Host-secreted mucus mediates intxn of dinoflagellate glycans and host lectins  
2. Phagocytosis  
3. Symbionts fight host immune system
