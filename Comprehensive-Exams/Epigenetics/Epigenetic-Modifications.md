# Epigenetic Modifications

See [DNA-methylation.md](https://github.com/emmastrand/EmmaStrand_Notebook/blob/master/Comprehensive-Exams/DNA-methylation/DNA-methylation.md) for breakdown of DNA methylation.

#### Types of Modifications

- DNA Methylation  
- Histone variants and posttranslational modifications   
- small non-coding RNAs  


## Chromatin Organization

**Histone variants and posttranslational modifications**  
From [*Eirin-Lopez and Putnam 2019*](https://github.com/emmastrand/EmmaStrand_Notebook/blob/master/Comprehensive-Exams/Epigenetics/annurev-marine-010318-095114.pdf): Some of these variants have been identified in marine invertebrates, including H2A.X, H2A.Z, and macroH2A, which are involved in critical roles in the epigenetic regulation of DNA structure and metabolism (Gonzalez-Romero et al. 2012, Moosmann et al. 2011)



## Environmental Epigenetics

The idea that epigenetic modifications and changes can lead to individual phenotypic changes (intragenerational plasticity) and phenotypic changes across progeny (transgenerational plasticity).

Marine Environmental Epigenetics ([Eirin-Lopez and Putnam 2019](https://github.com/emmastrand/EmmaStrand_Notebook/blob/master/Comprehensive-Exams/Epigenetics/annurev-marine-010318-095114.pdf)):  
- Challenge 1: Elucidating causeâ€“effects relationships among environmental signals, epigenetic modifications, and the dynamics of wash-in and wash-out of epigenetic effects.  
- Challenge 2: Generating a detailed mechanistic understanding of epigenetic mechanisms and their interplay.  
- Challenge 3: Demonstrating the capacity for and mechanisms of transgenerational epigenetic inheritance.  
- Challenge 4: Clarifying the interplay of genetic and epigenetic features and evolutionary consequences

### Epigenetic conditioning or hardening


## Epigenetic Crosstalk
H3K36me3 histone modification and gene body methylation is conserved in cnidarians
