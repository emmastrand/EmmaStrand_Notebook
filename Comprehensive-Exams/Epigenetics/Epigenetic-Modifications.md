# Epigenetic Modifications


### Environmental Epigenetics

Marine Environmental Epigenetics ([Eirin-Lopez and Putnam 2019](https://github.com/emmastrand/EmmaStrand_Notebook/blob/master/Comprehensive-Exams/Epigenetics/annurev-marine-010318-095114.pdf)):  
- Challenge 1: Elucidating causeâ€“effects relationships among environmental signals, epigenetic modifications, and the dynamics of wash-in and wash-out of epigenetic effects.  
- Challenge 2: Generating a detailed mechanistic understanding of epigenetic mechanisms and their interplay.  
- Challenge 3: Demonstrating the capacity for and mechanisms of transgenerational epigenetic inheritance.  
- Challenge 4: Clarifying the interplay of genetic and epigenetic features and evolutionary consequences
