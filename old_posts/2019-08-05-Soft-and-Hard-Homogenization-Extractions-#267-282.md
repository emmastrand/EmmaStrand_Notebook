# Soft and Hard Homogenization DNA/RNA Extractions #267-282

**20190805 E.S.**
DNA/RNA Extractions from *Montipora capitata* and *Pocillopora acuta* adult coral fragments from Holobiont Integration Hawaii 2018 project.  

Soft and Hard homogenization, and DNA/RNA Extractions followed this [protocol](https://github.com/emmastrand/EmmaStrand_Notebook/blob/master/_posts/2019-06-05-Soft-and-Hard-Homogenization-Protocol.md). General Zymo Duet DNA/RNA Extraction protocol found [here](https://github.com/emmastrand/EmmaStrand_Notebook/blob/master/_posts/2019-05-31-Zymo-Duet-RNA-DNA-Extraction-Protocol.md). With the following changes:  
- DNA: The first and second elutions were spun down in separate microcentrifuge tubes to compare the quantity and quality between the first and second elution. The first elution had no incubation period (previously 5 minutes) with 10 μl of Tris buffer and the second elution had a 15 minute incubation period (previously 5 minutes) with 100 μl of Tris buffer.  
- 10 μl aliquots of DNA and 5 μl aliquots of RNA (instead of 10 μl of each).  
- 2 coral fragments were used twice (6 coral fragments, 2 of which were done twice. 8 bead tubes used total) to compare DNA quality after the addition of a RNA/DNA shield wash. 500 μl of RNA/DNA shield "wash" step added before the 700 μl of Wash Buffer step for the duplicate extractions.   

Coral fragments were randomly chosen from different timepoint bags.

Fragment preparation start 11:00 end 11:18   
Soft/Hard homogenization start 11:19 end 11:51  
RNA DNA Extraction start 11:52 end 14:42

Extraction #s: 269, 270, 277, and 278 got the 500 μl RNA/DNA shield "wash" step in the DNA extractions only.

[Qubit](https://github.com/emmastrand/EmmaStrand_Notebook/blob/master/_posts/2019-05-31-Qubit-Protocol.md) used to check DNA and RNA quantity (ng/μl).  
[TapeStation](https://github.com/emmastrand/EmmaStrand_Notebook/blob/master/_posts/2019-05-31-TapeStation-Protocol.md) used to check RNA quality.

DNA Standard 1: 190.13 ng/μl  
DNA Standard 2: 21,227.88  ng/μl  
RNA Standard 1: 397.54  ng/μl  
RNA Standard 2: 10,498.84  ng/μl
