# Danielle Becker DNA RNA Extractions
### 20200123 Test extraction round for Danielle Becker coral samples.

DNA/RNA Extractions from Danielle Becker's *{Pocillopora*} coral samples using the following protocol: [Zymo Duet RNA DNA Extraction Protocol](https://github.com/emmastrand/EmmaStrand_Notebook/blob/master/_posts/2019-05-31-Zymo-Duet-RNA-DNA-Extraction-Protocol.md) and modified adult fragment tissue preparation steps described below:  
- Half of coral fragment clipped and 500 μl of DNA/RNA shield from sample tube placed in tube with 2 mL 0.5 mm glass beads.  
- 40 seconds at 20 Hz in the Tissue Lyser to remove tissue from coral skeleton.  
- Supernatant removed and placed in 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube for a stock solution (~700 μl).  
- 500 μl of tissue homogenate, 50 μl of Proteinase K Digestion buffer (1:10 ratio with tissue homogenate volume), and 25 μl of Proteinase K added to a new 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube.  
- 575 μl of Lysis Buffer added (1:1 ratio to tissue, Proteinase K Digestion buffer, and Proteinase K volume)  
- 1,150 μl of 100% molecular grade ethanol added to tissue for RNA portion of the protocol (1:1 ratio)  
- 50 μl Tris added to yellow spin column and incubated at room temperature for 5 minutes before centrifuged, and repeated for a total of 100 μl DNA.  
- 50 μl Tris added to green spin column and incubated at room temperature for 5 minutes before centrifuged, and repeated for a total of 100 μl RNA.  


[Qubit](https://github.com/emmastrand/EmmaStrand_Notebook/blob/master/_posts/2019-05-31-Qubit-Protocol.md) used to check DNA and RNA quantity (ng/μl).  
[TapeStation](https://github.com/emmastrand/EmmaStrand_Notebook/blob/master/_posts/2019-05-31-TapeStation-Protocol.md) used to check RNA quality.

### 20200127 DNA RNA extraction round for Danielle Becker coral samples.

DNA/RNA Extractions from Danielle Becker's *{Pocillopora*} coral samples using the following protocol: [Zymo Duet RNA DNA Extraction Protocol](https://github.com/emmastrand/EmmaStrand_Notebook/blob/master/_posts/2019-05-31-Zymo-Duet-RNA-DNA-Extraction-Protocol.md) and modified adult fragment tissue preparation steps described below:  
- Whole coral clipping and 700 μl of DNA/RNA shield from sample tube placed in tube with 2 mL 0.5 mm glass beads and 300 μl fresh DNA/RNA shield.  
- 40 seconds at 20 Hz in the Tissue Lyser to remove tissue from coral skeleton.  
- Supernatant removed and placed in 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube for a stock solution (~700 μl).  
- 500 μl of tissue homogenate, 50 μl of Proteinase K Digestion buffer (1:10 ratio with tissue homogenate volume), and 25 μl of Proteinase K added to a new 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube.  
- 575 μl of Lysis Buffer added (1:1 ratio to tissue, Proteinase K Digestion buffer, and Proteinase K volume)  
- 1,150 μl of 100% molecular grade ethanol added to tissue for RNA portion of the protocol (1:1 ratio)  
- 50 μl Tris added to yellow spin column and incubated at room temperature for 5 minutes before centrifuged, and repeated for a total of 100 μl DNA.  
- 50 μl Tris added to green spin column and incubated at room temperature for 5 minutes before centrifuged, and repeated for a total of 100 μl RNA.

Half of RNA flow-through from samples C30, E4, and E10 thrown out accidentally. 575 μl of sample (original sample, Proteinase K Digestion Buffer, and Proteinase K) and 575 μl of 100% molecular grade ethanol used. Spun down twice in total. All other samples followed 1,150 μl of sample and 1,150 μl of 100% ethanol protocol steps.
