# Putnam Lab Total Protein Protocol  

Goal: To quantify the total protein concentration in coral homogenate samples.   

Written for quantifying total protein of *Montipora capitata* and *Pocillopora acuta* fragments from the Holobiont Integration 2018 project.

Based on the following Putnam Lab Airbrushing protocols:  
[K. Wong protocol](https://kevinhwong1.github.io/KevinHWong_Notebook/Total-Protein-Extraction-Protocol/)  

This protocol is adapted to determine total protein content using the [Pierce BCA Protein Assay Kit from Thermo Scientific](https://www.thermofisher.com/order/catalog/product/23225?SID=srch-srp-23225).
