# Protein Kit Comparison Test

Pierce BCA "Purple/Old Kit" information [here]().

Pierce BCA Rapid Gold "New Kit" information [here]().

I used the Rapid Gold kit on my samples for the HoloInt project, but there was more variation and higher values than we were expecting in both *M. capitata* and *P. acuta*. This was the first time our lab used the Rapid Gold kit for corals so I re-did 38 samples with the older, "purple" kit. Below is a summary of the results: we concluded that the Rapid Gold kit does result in more variation and higher values than the older kit. I will move forward with re-doing all samples with the older, "purple" kit and we will save the Rapid Gold kits for teaching BIO345.
