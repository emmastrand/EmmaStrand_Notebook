# Processing the E5 January, March, September, and November 2020 Instantaneous Calcification Samples

Original protocol post from D. Becker: [here](https://github.com/daniellembecker/DanielleBecker_Lab_Notebook/blob/master/_posts/2021-02-18-E5-January-March-September-November-Calcification-Samples.md).

Putnam Lab Titration protcol [here](https://github.com/Putnam-Lab/Lab_Management/blob/master/Lab_Resources/Equipment_Protocols/Titrator_Protocols/Titrator_Protocol.md).

Emma, Pierrick, and Kristen are working together to process the remaining E5 samples on the titrator.

Schedule:


|           	| **Monday** 	| **Tuesday**                    	| **Wednesday**                               	| **Thursday**                   	| **Friday** 	|
|-----------	|-------------	|--------------------------------	|---------------------------------------------	|--------------------------------	|------------	|
| Personnel 	| Pierrick    	| Emma starts (~9 am); Kristen finishes (12:15-3:15p)  	| Kristen starts (~9a); Emma finishes (whenever Run2 is done)               	| Emma starts (~10 am); Kristen finishes (12:15-4:15p)  	| Pierrick   	|
| Runs      	| 1           	| 2                              	| 1                                           	| 2                              	| 1          	|
| Notes     	|             	|                                	| Tanks downstairs = Run1; E5 samples = Run2  	|                                	|            	|

Kristen, Pierrick, and Emma will do the physical titrations accroding to the schedule above. Emma will do all steps in [Titration Data Entry Process](https://github.com/daniellembecker/DanielleBecker_Lab_Notebook/blob/master/_posts/2021-02-18-E5-January-March-September-November-Calcification-Samples.md#titration-data-entry-process) and analyze data after Kristen and Pierrick push to github.

Goal: ~6-7 runs a week (8 samples each x 7 = 56 samples a week). We'll start with this and see how that schedule works for everyone's time and energy. Then adjust from there if needed.
