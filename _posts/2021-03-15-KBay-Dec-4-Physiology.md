# Physiology Processing for Dec 4 2019 timepoint

KBay Bleaching Pairs Timeseries Project. Dec 4 2019 did not have a physiology fragment during collection so after clipping and extractions, the rest of the fragments will be airbrushed and processed for physiology metrics at URI.

An example of the size of the fragment after clipping and extraction. Sizes of the fragments vary and this one is a bit bigger than others. I will try my best to get at least 500 uL of tissue homogenate from each fragment.

*M. capitata* extractions finished 2021-03-16. Post [here](https://github.com/emmastrand/EmmaStrand_Notebook/blob/master/_posts/2021-01-06-Kbay-Bleaching-2019-DNA-RNA-Extractions.md).  
*P. compressa* clipping to stay at URI for future molecular analyses.  
All fragments clipped to ship to UH for microbial analyses.  
The rest of the fragments are ready for physiology processing.  

## Processing Workflow

After the URI and UH clipping, the fragment will be airbrushed with 1X PBS. The tissue slurry will be homogenized and 100 uL will be aliquoted out for holobiont assays (i.e. total protein, TAC) before being centrifuged for 3 min at 13,000 rcf. The host fraction will be aliquoted out and volume recorded, and this can be used for host assays (i.e. protein, TAC). The pellet will be resuspended in 1 mL of 1X PBS. From this aliquot, 100 uL will be separated for Sym assays (symbiont counts, protein, TAC) and the remaining 900 uL will be used in a chlorophyll content assay.

The holobiont, host, and symbiont fractions saved can be used for future assays we want to do like lipid content.

If the volume is >2 mL for a coral fragment, then only 1 mL will be spun down following the 100 uL holobiont assay aliquot.
