# Physiology Processing for Dec 4 2019 timepoint

KBay Bleaching Pairs Timeseries Project. Dec 4 2019 did not have a physiology fragment during collection so after clipping and extractions, the rest of the fragments will be airbrushed and processed for physiology metrics at URI.

An example of the size of the fragment after clipping and extraction. Sizes of the fragments vary and this one is a bit bigger than others. I will try my best to get at least 500 uL of tissue homogenate from each fragment.
