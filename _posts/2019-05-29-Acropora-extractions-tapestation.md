### 20190529 Tape Station, Ship Samples

Protocol: [TapeStation](https://meschedl.github.io/MESPutnam_Open_Lab_Notebook/RNA-TapeStation-Protocol/)

TapeStation Notes:  
- Tape and buffer out at 9:18 am, done at 9:48 am
- Thermocycler start 10:09 end 10:15
- TapeStation start 10:19 end 10:29
- TapeStation did not read last sample (20, 221, C2) because I aborted the run right after I clicked start so I could spin the samples down, then started the TapeStation again and didn't realize the Tape had already been scanned once. Instead of 10 samples left, there were 9 and the 10th sample in our extractions wasn't read. The samples had not yet been pierced when I aborted the first run.   

TapeStation Results:

We want 500 ng of 5 TBR7 eggs and 5 FR eggs that have a matching sperm with DNA content. Below are the samples we decided to ship:

| 3            | 227       | eggs    | FR3_60   | 17.01         | 13.07          |
| 6            | 179       | eggs    | FR3_63   | 2.51          | 8.68           |
| 7            | 19        | eggs    | FR3_64   | 7.03          | 7.51           |

- TBR7_54's sperm sample did not have any DNA, but we shipped the eggs sample anyway so we could have 5 TBR and 5 FR samples.

Aliquoting the samples:
M. Schedl aliquoted extraction numbers 1, 3, 4, 6, and 7 previously.

- ng/uL is the average reading from the Qubit
- sample volume is ng/uL value divided by 500 to get how much volume of sample is needed to have 500 ng of RNA
- water volume is how much volume of water is needed to have at least 10 uL of liquid to ship
- concentration is how many ug of sample per uL is in the shipment

Other information for shipping:
- Species: *Acropora hyacinthus*
- Sample Buffer: ultra pure water
