# DNA RNA Extraction for Pocillopora meandrina

DNA RNA Extraction using this [protocol](https://github.com/emmastrand/EmmaStrand_Notebook/blob/master/_posts/2019-05-31-Zymo-Duet-RNA-DNA-Extraction-Protocol.md).  

*Pocillopora meandrina* fragments were vortexed for 2 minutes. The same fragment was extracted twice to try to get the best RNA to use moving forward (PM-1 and PM-2).

Coral ID: Pocillopora meandrina bleached III Sep 2020 EN/PD that was shipped from Coral Resistance Lab in Hawaii.
