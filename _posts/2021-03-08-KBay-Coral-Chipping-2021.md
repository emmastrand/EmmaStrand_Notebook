# KBay Coral Chipping 2021

### Coral Chipping Spreadsheet

Thank you for all for the help and assistance with chipping! Below is a set of instructions on how to chip the coral fragment so that we keep this uniform across so many people helping.

The list of coral fragments is located [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1m1qwjfMG3m0zj_tGrGIZ0ADjBRcVJbe9dgQbtz4K-hI/edit#gid=0). Colony ID is the ID of the coral fragment, which will be written on the whirlpak the coral fragment is in. Species is either *Montipora capitata* or *Porites compressa*. Timepoint is the sampling date for that coral fragment.

Please sign up for how many fragments you are able to chip under the column 'Chipping Tech' with your name (example below). For example, if I chipped these two fragments, I include my name and the date I chipped the coral. **Only fill in the date chipped after you have actually done this, not the date you plan to.**  

Example of spreadsheet above:  

| Colony ID 	| Species            	| Timepoint 	| Chip Date 	| Chipping Tech 	|
|-----------	|--------------------	|-----------	|-----------	|---------------	|
| 3         	| Montipora capitata 	| 9/16/19   	| 20210309  	| Emma          	|
| 4         	| Montipora capitata 	| 9/16/19   	| 20210309  	| Emma          	|

Each coral will take ~5 minutes to chip.

Book your time on the organismal bench 1 or 2 on the [teamup schedule](https://teamup.com/c/h2sumb/ppp-and-thornber-labs). Please be mindful of the COVID restrictions we have in lab: 5 people max at a time (total for both sides) and for the Putnam lab: 1 person on molecular side and 1 person on organismal side at a time until midnight the night before (i.e. if Kevin is on molecular bench doing his own thing and Danielle is already on the microscope bench counting away then I have to wait until midnight the night before to take the open organismal bench 2 spot and only if there aren't already 5 people in at that time). Please come in at your assigned time and change your time slot to reflect how late you stay. If you sign up for 1-4 pm, but only stay until 3 pm then before you leave lab, change your time slot to reflect 3 pm. Other people check this calendar frequently to see when they can come in and arrange their schedules around the lab schedule so we want to be very mindful of taking up lab time and space.

### Location of coral fragment whirlpaks

Corals are kept in their sampling date timepoint in individual whirlpaks. These fragments need to be kept at -80C so the larger bag needs to be kept in the freezer, only remove the whirlpak you are clipping one at a time.

Each timepoint is in its own mesh bag labeled with the timepoint and "KBay Bleaching". Please keep these altogether in the freezer while you are clipping the fragments.

Mesh bags are kept in

### Chipping the coral fragment

These fragments need to be kept cold at all times so do the following steps swiftly but do not rush.

1. Wipe down the organismal bench with 70% ethanol and DI water.  
2. Set clean paper towels down on the benchtop to cover the small area you're working in.  
3. Sterilize the [coral chipping tool](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01EAGXF56/?coliid=I3SR5REHM9D4P7&colid=YVLE2UPC0DQ4&psc=1&ref_=lv_cv_lig_dp_it) with (in order): 10% bleach, Type II DI water, 70% ethanol, and Type II DI water. For each solution: add a small amount of that solution to a kimwipe, and wipe the metal portion used for chipping the coral. Wipe your gloves with a small amount of 70% ethanol.    
4. Grab dry ice and cooler from the freezer. If we do not have any dry ice, grab the big bin of cold freezer beads kept in 20C freezer next to the chest freezer.  
4. Grab the desired coral fragment from the freezer. Keep the fragment on dry ice (or in cold freezer beads) while you neatly label a new 2 mm screw cap tube with: 1.) colony ID (write this piece of information multiple times on the tube) 2.) Species ("Mcap", "Pcom") 3.) Timepoint (write this piece of information multiple times on the tube). See below image for an example.    
5. Once back at the organismal bench, unwrap the whirlpak and slowly move the coral fragment towards the opening of the whirlpak using your hands on the outside of the whirlpak so that you are not touching the coral fragment with your gloves.  
6. While holding the fragment with one hand, take the coral chipping tool with the other hand and chip off ~2 cm piece of the coral fragment. Immediately place this fragment in a 2 mm screw cap tube.  
7. Place both the 2 mm screw cap tube in the appropriate freezer box (see above section for photo) and the coral fragment back in the original mesh bag you pulled it from. Please be mindful that you are placing the fragment and screw cap tube in the correct mesh bag and freezer box.  
8. Repeat these steps for as many fragments as you have time for.

Send a slack message to Emma with what you were able to get done and update the [google spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1m1qwjfMG3m0zj_tGrGIZ0ADjBRcVJbe9dgQbtz4K-hI/edit#gid=0) with the fragments you chipped. **Please do this before you leave lab so that another labmate doesn't come in after you and chip the same coral.**
