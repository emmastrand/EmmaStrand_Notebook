# Lab Plan for Holobiont Integration project

## Protocols

**Tissue extraction for molecular work**  
Beadbeating protocol: ["Sample Prep" in K. Wong's post](https://kevinhwong1.github.io/KevinHWong_Notebook/Zymo-DNA-RNA-Extraction-Protocol/)  
Separating symbionts from host in a tissue slurry: [Protocol](https://kevinhwong1.github.io/KevinHWong_Notebook/Adult-coral-Homogenate-prep-and-symbiont-separation/)

**DNA & RNA extraction**  
Protocol: [Zymo-Duet](https://kevinhwong1.github.io/KevinHWong_Notebook/Zymo-DNA-RNA-Extraction-Protocol/)

To test RNA and DNA quantity: [Qubit](https://meschedl.github.io/MESPutnam_Open_Lab_Notebook/Qubit-Protocol/)  
To test RNA quality: [TapeStation](https://meschedl.github.io/MESPutnam_Open_Lab_Notebook/RNA-TapeStation-Protocol/)  
To test DNA quality: [Gel Electrophoresis](https://meschedl.github.io/MESPutnam_Open_Lab_Notebook/Gel-Protocol/)

**Tissue extraction for physiology**  
Airbrushing: [HIMB Protocol](https://github.com/emmastrand/HIMB_Bleaching_2018/blob/master/Protocols/Airbrushing_HIMB%20Protocol.md)

**Chlorophyll concentration**  
Following the protocol in: [Wall et al 2018](https://par.nsf.gov/servlets/purl/10056422)

**Lipid content**  
Following Chris Wall's protocol: [Lipids](https://github.com/emmastrand/EmmaStrand_Notebook/blob/master/protocols/Lipid_funnel%20protocol.pdf)  
Check on these supplies:
- Chloroform ACS grade
- Methanol ACS grade
- 0.88% KCl
- UHP grade 5.0 nitrogen
- Glass fiber filters
- aluminum pans
- large and small amber vials
- cork borer and sharpener

**Surface area**  
Wax-dipping: Following [Stimson and Kinzie 1991](http://www2.hawaii.edu/~kinzie/documents/CV%20&%20pubs/stimson001.pdf)  
Method should vary with species of coral (depending on coralite structure), but single wax dip is the most effective ([Veal et al 2010](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2Fs00338-010-0647-9.pdf)).  
Small corallite (*Porites sp., Stylophora sp.*) structure - single wax dip   
*Acropora sp.* needs double wax dip to seal deep corallites  
Complex corallites (*Goniastrea sp.*) - single wax dip

**Cell counts**  
"By-hand" Protocol: [Symbiont Density](https://kevinhwong1.github.io/KevinHWong_Notebook/Symbiodinium-Density-Analysis-Protocol/)  
Flow Cytometer:  
[Prep cells](https://www.thermofisher.com/us/en/home/references/protocols/cell-and-tissue-analysis/protocols/cell-preparation-flow-cytometery.html#protocol-a)  


**Total protein**  
Protocol: [Pierce BCA](https://kevinhwong1.github.io/KevinHWong_Notebook/Total-Protein-Extraction-Protocol/)

**Dry biomass**  
Portions of the tissue slurry were dried (60 °C) to calculate dry biomass.  
Protocol: ___

**Ash-free dry weight**  
Portions of the tissue slurry were baked in a muffle furnace (4 hours at 500 °C) to calculate ash free dry weight as the difference between dry weight and the ash weight  
Protocol: ____  
Can be done in the lipid protocol

## Schedule
Week of June 3rd - June 7th: lab work planning, 4 coral fragment RNA DNA protocol testing 2 rounds, bead beating testing 1 round.
Week of June 10th - 14th: Emma out of town the 11th through the 18th.  
Week of June 17th - 21st: order materials, lab work planning, outside of lab work.
Week of June 24th - 28th:  
Week of July 1st - July 5th:  
Week of July 8th - July 12th:  
Week of July 15th - July 19th:
