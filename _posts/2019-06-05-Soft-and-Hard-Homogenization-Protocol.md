# Soft and Hard Homogenization Protocol
Goal: To extract DNA and RNA from coral fragments and to enrich for host in the first "soft homogenization" fraction and holobiont in the "hard homogenization" fraction.

Testing to see if "Soft homogenization" will include DNA and RNA from primarily the host for transcriptomics and DNA methylation analysis. "Hard homogenization" will include the DNA from the symbionts and microbiome for ITS2 and 16s amplification and Holobiont RNA.

### Protocol Preparation

**Reagents and supplies**
- RNAse Away
- RNA/DNA shield   
- RNAse-free water
- Proteinase K digestion buffer
- Proteinase K  
- Isopropanol  
- 10mM Tris HCl pH 8.0 made with RNase-free water  
- 10% bleach
- Zymo Duet DNA/RNA Extraction kit buffers: DNA/RNA lysis buffer, DNA/RNA Prep Buffer, DNA/RNA Wash Buffer, DNA Digestion buffer, and DNase I

**Equipment**  
- Rocking oven that can be set at 55 &deg;C
- Thermomixer
- Vortexer  
- Qiagen Tissue Lyser: [Handbook](https://www.qiagen.com/us/resources/resourcedetail?id=65e7826c-4d50-4faf-8154-2fbc782c41a6&lang=en)
- Bead tubes: 2mL 0.5mm glass beads and tubes from [Fisher Scientific](https://www.fishersci.com/shop/products/bead-tube-2ml-0-5mm-glass-50pk/15340152)
- Designated RNAse free space  
- Tabletop and larger centrifuges for 1.5 mL capable of 12,000xg  
- Clippers

### Reagent Preparation

1. Add 96 mL 100% ethanol (104 mL 95% ethanol) to the 24 mL DNA/RNA Wash Buffer concentrate before use. DNA/RNA Wash Buffer included with D7003T (Mini Prep Plus Kit) is supplied ready-to-use and does not require the addition of ethanol prior to use. Check kit contents and instructions to confirm prep steps.  
2. Reconstitute the lyophilized (freeze-dried) DNase I as indicated on the vial prior to use. Mix by inversion. Store frozen aliquots.  
3. Reconstitute the lyophilized (freeze-dried) 20 mg Proteinase K with 1040 uL Proteinase K Storage Buffer or lyophilized (freeze-dried) 5 mg Proteinase K with 260 uL Proteinase K Storage Buffer. Vortex to dissolve. Store at -20 &deg;C.

### Fragment Preparation

Sterilizing working area:
I. Rinse clippers with:
  1. 10% bleach solution  
  2. DI water  
  3. Isopropanol  
  4. RNAse free water

II. Spray gloves with RNAse away and rub hands together.

Take fragments one at a time out of the freezer and sterilize clippers in between every fragment. These steps are time sensitive to prevent the coral fragments and freezer from thawing. Do not rush, but be efficient.

Assign "extraction numbers" to each ID for ease of labeling. See below chart for an example:  

| Extraction # | Coral ID | Species     | Homogenization |
|--------------|----------|-------------|----------------|
| 1            | 1123     | Montipora   | Soft           |
| 2            | 1123     | Montipora   | Hard           |
| 3            | 1769     | Montipora   | Soft           |
| 4            | 1769     | Montipora   | Hard           |
| 5            | 1056     | Pocillopora | Soft           |
| 6            | 1056     | Pocillopora | Hard           |
| 7            | 1607     | Pocillopora | Soft           |
| 8            | 1607     | Pocillopora | Hard           |

Clipping fragment:  
1. Label the lid of a bead tube with the coral fragment's sample ID number, and the side of the tube with the coral fragment ID and today's date.  
2. Add 1000 μl of RNA/DNA shield to the bead tube.
3. Remove desired fragment from -80 &deg;C freezer.  
4. Using sterilized clippers, clip off 1-2 small pieces and place into the bead tube. RNA/DNA shield needs to cover the fragments.

*Repeat above steps 1-5 for each fragment before moving on.*

### Soft and Hard Homogenization

5. Vortex for *Pocillopora* fragments for 1 minute and the *Montipora* fragments for 2 minutes. Leave the settings on and on max power. This is the "soft homogenization" step.  
6. After vortex time, check to see if the tissue is coming off of the skeleton and look for coloration change in shield liquid.  
7. Remove supernatant from the bead tube and place in a new 1.5 microcentrifuge tube labeled on the side with the extraction ID number, coral fragment's sample ID number, "soft", and today's date. Label the cap of the microcentrifuge tube with the extraction number. This supernatant will become the sample for "soft homogenization". The remaining chunks of fragment will become the sample for "hard homogenization".  
8. Add 500 μl of RNA/DNA shield to the bead tube with the coral fragment pieces. RNA/DNA shield needs to cover the fragment pieces.   
9. Place the beads tubes with the coral fragment pieces in the Qiagen Tissue Lyser Adapter Set 2 x 24.  
10. Operate the Tissue Lyser for 1 minute at 20 Hz.       
11. Remove the supernatant and put in a new 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube labeled on the side with the extraction ID number, coral fragment's sample ID number, "hard", and today's date. Label the cap of the microcentrifuge tube with the extraction ID number.  
12. Add 300 μl of sample, 30 μl of Proteinase K digestion buffer (10:1 ratio of sample:digestion buffer), and 15 μl of Proteinase K (2:1 ratio of digestion buffer:Proteinase K) to a new 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube.  
> At this point, each coral fragment should have 2 tubes to move forward to extractions with: one for soft homogenization and one for hard homogenization.  
For 4 coral fragments: 4 bead tubes with coral fragment pieces, 8 tubes with leftover homogenate sample (4 soft, 4 hard), and 8 tubes with homogenate, Proteinase K digestion buffer, and Proteinase K (4 soft, 4 hard).   

13. Vortex and spin down all tubes.   
14. Place bead tubes and leftover homogenate tubes in -80 &deg;C freezer.

### Solution Key:
**DNA/RNA Lysis Buffer**: Contains a high concentration of chaotropic salts, which destabilize hydrogen bonds, van der Waals forces and hydrophobic interactions. This destabilizes proteins, including nucleases. The buffer will also disrupt association of nucleic acids with water.    
**DNA/RNA Wash Buffer**: Used to remove residual proteins and carbohydrates, and purifies the molecular end product.  
**DNase I**: deoxyribonuclease is an enzyme that catalyzes the hydrolytic cleavage of phosphodiester linkages in the DNA backbone, thus degrading DNA. This is used in the RNA extraction step to purify RNA final product.  
**DNA/RNA Prep Buffer**: Ethanol and guanidinium chloride used a deproteinization measure. Guanidinium is a very strong denaturing agent that will dissolve cells and RNAses.  
**EtOH**: the addition of alcohol further enhances and influences the binding of nucleic aicds to the silica (see spin colum description below).  
**10 mM Tris HCl**: DNA is more stable at slightly basic pH and will dissolve faster in a buffer than water. Using Tris instead of water will enhance rehydration of high molecular weight DNA.  
**DNA/RNase free water**: Used as an elution in the RNA extraction steps. RNA can tolerate a slightly acidic pH and dissolves. Warmed water as an elution increases high molecular yield.  
**Yellow DNA/Green RNA Spin Columns**: contain a silica membrane that binds to nucleic acids. Proteins and polysaccharides should be in the flow-through liquid that is discarded while RNA and DNA is kept on the membrane.    
**Proteinase K**: an enzyme that cleaves the peptide bond in proteins next to the carboxyl group of hydrophobic amino acid residues. This decontaminates the sample and leaves purified DNA/RNA.

General workflow of an extraction:  
1. Cell lysis through disruption of cellular membranes  
2. Dehydration and precipitation of the cellular proteins (protein denaturation)  
3. Separation of cellular proteins and other cellular components out of the nucleic acid  
4. Precipitation and dissolving the nucleic acid
