**20191204 E.S.**
DNA/RNA Extractions from *Montipora capitata* and *Pocillopora acuta* adult coral fragments from Holobiont Integration Hawaii 2018 project.  

Soft and Hard homogenization, and DNA/RNA Extractions followed this [protocol](https://github.com/emmastrand/EmmaStrand_Notebook/blob/master/_posts/2019-06-05-Soft-and-Hard-Homogenization-Protocol.md). General Zymo Duet DNA/RNA Extraction protocol found [here](https://github.com/emmastrand/EmmaStrand_Notebook/blob/master/_posts/2019-05-31-Zymo-Duet-RNA-DNA-Extraction-Protocol.md). With the following changes:  
- DNA: The first and second elutions were spun down in separate microcentrifuge tubes to compare the quantity and quality between the first and second elution. The first elution had no incubation period (previously 5 minutes) with 10 μl of Tris buffer and the second elution had a 15 minute incubation period (previously 5 minutes) with 100 μl of Tris buffer.  
- 10 μl aliquots of DNA and 5 μl aliquots of RNA (instead of 10 μl of each).  


[Qubit](https://github.com/emmastrand/EmmaStrand_Notebook/blob/master/_posts/2019-05-31-Qubit-Protocol.md) used to check DNA and RNA quantity (ng/μl).  
[TapeStation](https://github.com/emmastrand/EmmaStrand_Notebook/blob/master/_posts/2019-05-31-TapeStation-Protocol.md) used to check RNA quality.

High Sensitivity:  
DNA Standard 1:   ng/μl  
DNA Standard 2:   ng/μl  
RNA Standard 1:   ng/μl  
RNA Standard 2:   ng/μl
