# Physiological Parameters Protocol Testing

Goal: To determine the minimum amount of homogenate volume necessary from healthy and bleached fragments to produce accurate readings from physiological parameters (total protein, chlorophyll-A concentration, lipid content, total antioxidant capacity, symbiont counts).

**20191023 E.S.** Airbrushing, Homogenization, Aliquoting, Bleaching

Two healthy and two bleached fragments were chosen from the 20181215 molecular back-burner fragments and airbrushed/homogenized following the Putnam Lab Airbrush [protocol](https://emmastrand.github.io/EmmaStrand_Notebook/Airbrushing-Protocol/).

Coral skeletons were placed in 20% bleach for 24 hours (20191023), and then left out to dry for 24 hours (20191024).
