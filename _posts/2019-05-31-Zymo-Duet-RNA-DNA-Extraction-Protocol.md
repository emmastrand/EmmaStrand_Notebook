# Zymo Duet DNA/RNA Extraction Protocol

Zymo's Duet [RNA DNA Extraction](https://files.zymoresearch.com/protocols/_d7003t_d7003_quick-dna-rna_miniprep_plus_kit.pdf) kit was modified for our lab.

Based on Putnam Lab protocols written by: [E. Chille](https://echille.github.io/E.-Chille-Open-Lab-Notebook/Protocol-for-DNA-RNA-Extractions-of-Montipora-Coral-Larvae-Using-Zymo-Duet-Extraction-Kit/) and [K. Wong](https://github.com/kevinhwong1/KevinHWong_Notebook/blob/master/_posts/2019-03-13-Zymo-DNA-RNA-Extract-P.astreoides-Genome.md).

### Reagent Preparation

1. Add 96 mL 100% ethanol (104 mL 95% ethanol) to the 24 mL DNA/RNA Wash Buffer concentrate before use. DNA/RNA Wash Buffer included with D7003T (Mini Prep Plus Kit) is supplied ready-to-use and does not require the addition of ethanol prior to use. Check kit contents and instructions to confirm prep steps.  
2. Reconstitute the lyophilized (freeze-dried) DNase I as indicated on the vial prior to use. Mix by inversion. Store frozen aliquots.  
3. Reconstitute the lyophilized (freeze-dried) 20 mg Proteinase K with 1040 uL Proteinase K Storage Buffer or lyophilized (freeze-dried) 5 mg Proteinase K with 260 uL Proteinase K Storage Buffer. Vortex to dissolve. Store at -20 &deg;C.

### Adult Fragment Tissue Sample Preparation

Bead tubes: 2 mL 0.5 mm glass beads and tubes from [Fisher Scientific](https://www.fishersci.com/shop/products/bead-tube-2ml-0-5mm-glass-50pk/15340152)

Sterilizing working area:
I. Rinse clippers with:
  1. 10% bleach solution  
  2. DI water  
  3. Isopropanol  
  4. RNAse free water

II. Spray gloves with RNAse away and rub hands together.

Take fragments one at a time out of the freezer and sterilize clippers in between every fragment. These steps are time sensitive to prevent the coral fragments and freezer from thawing. Do not rush, but be efficient.

#### Fragment Clipping in DNA/RNA Shield

1. Take 500 uL of DNA/RNA shield from the original sample tube into a new 2 mL 0.5 glass bead tube.  
2. Using sterilized clippers, cut coral clipping in half (depending on the size, keep the entire clipping) and place in 2 mL 0.5 mm bead tube from step 1.  
3. Add 500 uL new DNA/RNA shield to the bead tube with the coral fragment from step 1 and 2.  
4. Proceed to homogenization steps.

Depending on desired DNA RNA quantity, you can increase the amount of uL added of the original DNA RNA shield from the original sampling tube or increase the size of fragment used.

#### Whole Snap-Frozen Fragment  

1. Label the side of a bead tube with the coral fragment's sample ID number, your initials, and today's date. Label the cap of the bead tube with the coral ID number.       
2. Add 1000 μl of RNA/DNA shield to the tube.
3. Remove desired fragment from -80 &deg;C freezer.  
4. Using sterilized clippers, clip off 3-4 small pieces and place all the pieces into the 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube. RNA/DNA shield needs to cover the fragments.  
5. Proceed to homogenization steps.

#### Homogenization

1. Vortex the 2 mL 0.5 mm glass bead tube for 1 minute for *Pocillopora spp.* and 2 minutes for *Montipora spp.*. The amount of time for vortexing will depend on the coral skeletal structure and how easily the tissue separates from the skeleton. Too much vortexing can cause DNA/RNA degradation, but too little vortexing can result in minimal DNA/RNA yield.  
2. After vortexing, check to see if most of the tissue has come off of the skeleton and that the DNA/RNA shield has darkened in color.  
3. Remove supernatant and place in a new 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube. Save the bead tube with the skeleton fragment in -80 &deg;C freezer as a potential back-up in case the extraction doesn't work. Label 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube as desired.  
4. Proceed to DNA Extraction steps.  

We have tried an alternative homogenization method to separate the host and symbiont tissue in the extraction process: [Soft and Hard Homogenization](https://emmastrand.github.io/EmmaStrand_Notebook/Soft-and-Hard-Homogenization-Protocol/). This didn't work as desired for us, but has room for improvement.

### Larvae Sample Preparation
From [E. Chille's Putnam Lab Protocol](https://echille.github.io/E.-Chille-Open-Lab-Notebook/Protocol-for-DNA-RNA-Extractions-of-Montipora-Coral-Larvae-Using-Zymo-Duet-Extraction-Kit/):
1. Take sample tube with larvae 1 at a time out of the -80 &deg;C to minimize amount of thawing  
2. Add 300 µl DNA/RNA shield directly to the sample tube  
3. Record tube number  
4. Add 30 µl of PK digestion buffer to each sample tube  
5. Add 15 µl Proteinase K to each sample tube  
6. Vortex and spin down sample tubes  
7. Place in Thermoixer for ~3 hours at 55 &deg;C, shaking at 1100 rpm. Check periodically to monitor digestion progress.  
8. After digestion proceed with DNA and RNA Extraction.

30. Store all tubes in the -80 &deg;C

### Extraction Content Analysis
*These steps analyze the quantity and quality of the DNA/RNA extracted and may be done on a separate day from the extraction*

#### RNA/DNA Quantity  
Follow Broad Range dsDNA and RNA Qubit [protocol](https://meschedl.github.io/MESPutnam_Open_Lab_Notebook/Qubit-Protocol/) to analyze sample ++quantity++. Read all samples twice.

#### DNA Quality  
If DNA quantity is sufficient (typically >10 ng/µL) follow the PPP Agarose Gel [Protocol](https://meschedl.github.io/MESPutnam_Open_Lab_Notebook/Gel-Protocol/) to determine DNA quality. "Good" DNA should form a distinct band a the very top of the gel. See example below:

![annotated-biomin-gel-batches-4-5.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/echille/E.-Chille-Open-Lab-Notebook/master/images/annotated-biomin-gel-batches-4-5.png)

#### RNA Quality  
If RNA quantity is sufficient follow the Tape Station [Protocol](https://meschedl.github.io/MESPutnam_Open_Lab_Notebook/RNA-TapeStation-Protocol/) to determine RNA quality and obtain a RNA Integrity Number (RIN). "Good" RNA should have a RIN above 8.0 and form two distinct peaks at the 18S and 28S locations. See example below:
