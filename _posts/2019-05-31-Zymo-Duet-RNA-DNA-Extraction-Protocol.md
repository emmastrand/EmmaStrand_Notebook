# Zymo Duet DNA/RNA Extraction Protocol

Zymo's Duet [RNA DNA Extraction](https://files.zymoresearch.com/protocols/_d7003t_d7003_quick-dna-rna_miniprep_plus_kit.pdf) kit was modified for our lab.

Based on Putnam Lab protocols written by: [E. Chille](https://echille.github.io/E.-Chille-Open-Lab-Notebook/Protocol-for-DNA-RNA-Extractions-of-Montipora-Coral-Larvae-Using-Zymo-Duet-Extraction-Kit/) and [K. Wong](https://github.com/kevinhwong1/KevinHWong_Notebook/blob/master/_posts/2019-03-13-Zymo-DNA-RNA-Extract-P.astreoides-Genome.md).

### Reagent Preparation

1. Add 96 mL 100% ethanol (104 mL 95% ethanol) to the 24 mL DNA/RNA Wash Buffer concentrate before use. DNA/RNA Wash Buffer included with D7003T (Mini Prep Plus Kit) is supplied ready-to-use and does not require the addition of ethanol prior to use. Check kit contents and instructions to confirm prep steps.  
2. Reconstitute the lyophilized (freeze-dried) DNase I as indicated on the vial prior to use. Mix by inversion. Store frozen aliquots.  
3. Reconstitute the lyophilized (freeze-dried) 20 mg Proteinase K with 1040 uL Proteinase K Storage Buffer or lyophilized (freeze-dried) 5 mg Proteinase K with 260 uL Proteinase K Storage Buffer. Vortex to dissolve. Store at -20 &deg;C.

### Adult Fragment Tissue Sample Preparation

Bead tubes: 2 mL 0.5 mm glass beads and tubes from [Fisher Scientific](https://www.fishersci.com/shop/products/bead-tube-2ml-0-5mm-glass-50pk/15340152)

Sterilizing working area:
I. Rinse clippers with:
  1. 10% bleach solution  
  2. DI water  
  3. Isopropanol  
  4. RNAse free water

II. Spray gloves with RNAse away and rub hands together.

Take fragments one at a time out of the freezer and sterilize clippers in between every fragment. These steps are time sensitive to prevent the coral fragments and freezer from thawing. Do not rush, but be efficient.

Clipping fragment:  
1. Label the side of a bead tube with the coral fragment's sample ID number, your initials, and today's date. Label the cap of the bead tube with the coral ID number.       
2. Add 1000 μl of RNA/DNA shield to the tube.
3. Remove desired fragment from -80 &deg;C freezer.  
4. Using sterilized clippers, clip off 3-4 small pieces and place all the pieces into the 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube. RNA/DNA shield needs to cover the fragments.

### Larvae Sample Preparation
From [E. Chille's Putnam Lab Protocol](https://echille.github.io/E.-Chille-Open-Lab-Notebook/Protocol-for-DNA-RNA-Extractions-of-Montipora-Coral-Larvae-Using-Zymo-Duet-Extraction-Kit/):
1. Take sample tube with larvae 1 at a time out of the -80 &deg;C to minimize amount of thawing  
2. Add 300 µl DNA/RNA shield directly to the sample tube  
3. Record tube number  
4. Add 30 µl of PK digestion buffer to each sample tube  
5. Add 15 µl Proteinase K to each sample tube  
6. Vortex and spin down sample tubes  
7. Place in Thermoixer for ~3 hours at 55 &deg;C, shaking at 1100 rpm. Check periodically to monitor digestion progress.  
8. After digestion proceed with DNA and RNA Extraction.  

### DNA Extraction
1. Set up yellow DNA spin columns and collection tubes, label appropriately
2. Warm elution liquids to 70 degrees &deg;C (10mM Tris HCl pH. 8.0 and RNase free water)
3. Add equal volume (345 µl) DNA/RNA lysis buffer to each sample tube
4. Finger flick to mix tubes
5. Add 700 µl (total volume) of sample gently to the yellow DNA spin column
6. Centrifuge at 16,000 rcf (g) for 30 seconds
7. **Important** Save the flow through from this step: transfer to a new 1.5mL tube labeled for RNA
8. Add 400µl DNA/RNA Prep Buffer gently to the yellow DNA spin columns
9. Centrifuge at 16,000 rcf (g) for 30 seconds
10. Discard flow through (Zymo kit waste)
11. Add 700 µl DNA/RNA Wash Buffer gently to the yellow DNA spin columns
12. Centrifuge at 16,000 rcf (g) for 30 seconds
13. Discard flow through (Zymo kit waste)
14. Add 400 µl DNA/RNA Wash Buffer genetly to the yellow DNA spin columns
15. Centrifuge at 16,000 rcf (g) for **2 minutes**
16. Discard flow through (Zymo kit waste)
17. Transfer yellow columns to new 1.5mL microcentrifuge tubes
18. Add 50 µl warmed 10 mM Tris HCl to each yellow DNA column by dripping slowly directly on the filer
19. Incubate at room temp for 5 minutes
20. Centrifuge at 16,000 rcf (g) for 30 seconds
21. Repeat steps 18-20 for a final elution volume of 100 µl
22. Label tubes, store at 4 &deg;C if quantifying the same day or the next, if waiting longer store in -20 &deg;C

### RNA Extraction
*Can do concurrently with DNA Extraction after DNA Extraction Step 7*
1. Add equal volume (700 µl) 100% EtOH to the 1.5mL tubes labeled for RNA containing the original yellow column flow through
2. Vortex and spin down to mix
3. Add 700 µl of that liquid to the green RNA spin columns

30. Store all tubes in the -80 &deg;C

### Extraction Content Analysis
*These steps analyze the quantity and quality of the DNA/RNA extracted and may be done on a separate day from the extraction*

#### RNA/DNA Quantity  
Follow Broad Range dsDNA and RNA Qubit [protocol](https://meschedl.github.io/MESPutnam_Open_Lab_Notebook/Qubit-Protocol/) to analyze sample ++quantity++. Read all samples twice.

#### DNA Quality  
If DNA quantity is sufficient (typically >10 ng/µL) follow the PPP Agarose Gel [Protocol](https://meschedl.github.io/MESPutnam_Open_Lab_Notebook/Gel-Protocol/) to determine DNA quality. "Good" DNA should form a distinct band a the very top of the gel. See example below:

![annotated-biomin-gel-batches-4-5.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/echille/E.-Chille-Open-Lab-Notebook/master/images/annotated-biomin-gel-batches-4-5.png)

#### RNA Quality  
If RNA quantity is sufficient follow the Tape Station [Protocol](https://meschedl.github.io/MESPutnam_Open_Lab_Notebook/RNA-TapeStation-Protocol/) to determine RNA quality and obtain a RNA Integrity Number (RIN). "Good" RNA should have a RIN above 8.0 and form two distinct peaks at the 18S and 28S locations. See example below:
