# Andromeda Clean Up Fall 2022

### /data/putnamlab/estrand/16S_E5

I deleted the raw files becasue these also exist in my github lab notebook. These are trial 16S files from the E5 team and I believe also exist at Shedd with Ross. The lab work was not done or sequenced at URI. 

### /data/putnamlab/estrand/Acc_dy

This appears to be some fasta file.. with protein codes? Where did this come from? Can I delete it? ... circle back to this. 

### /data/putnamlab/estrand/BleachingPairs_16S

Raw data files are on NCBI for this project.
