# Holobiont Integration WGBS Sample Processing

Test runs were completed prior to sample processing: see notebook post [here](https://github.com/emmastrand/EmmaStrand_Notebook/blob/master/_posts/2020-10-21-WGBS-Pico-Methyl-Seq-Test-Run.md).    
Maggie's notebook posts for processing Danielle Becker's samples is [here](https://github.com/meschedl/MESPutnam_Open_Lab_Notebook/blob/master/_posts/2020-09-24-Danielle-WGBS.md) (as another point of reference).    
Putnam Lab Protocol found [here](https://github.com/meschedl/MESPutnam_Open_Lab_Notebook/blob/master/_posts/2020-09-18-WGBS-PMS-protocol.md).  
Dennis's WGBS test runs (10 pg - 100 ng input) found [here](https://github.com/dconetta/DAC_Putnam_Lab_Notebook/blob/master/_posts/2019-08-15-PMS-Input-Conc-Tests.md).

### Pico Methylation Prep
I'm running my samples with a 10 ng input. I dilute my samples to 5 ng/uL so that I can take 2 uL of DNA and 18 uL Tris HCl for the bisulfite conversion step.   

Link to my google spreadsheet for sample processing [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1lWT0KRO5x9RFflYMF9Jnk5lsGCo0k3_A98ZsyKd4kks/edit#gid=978992575) (if you don't already have access, you may request it via a google email address). This includes 5 ng/uL dilution calculations, dilution platemaps, amplification step calculations, indices information, and post-PMS protocol quantification.

For Holobiont Integration, we are processing 5 timepoints: 30 hour, 2 weeks, 4 weeks, 8 weeks, and 12 weeks (n=60).

**Notes**  
- P. acuta 2878 has already been sequenced from this project for the methylation methods comparison paper so we won't need to do this one again.  
- I started with n=3 and n=4 during trial runs but worked my way up to n=8 and n=10 at a time for this protocol. My maximum will probably be 16 samples at a time.  
- These samples will be sequenced with K. Wong and my 2nd chapter Hawaii Bleaching Pairs project. This will span across 4 lanes, each project taking up its own lane and HoloInt using 2 lanes.  
- HoloInt indices: #1-60
